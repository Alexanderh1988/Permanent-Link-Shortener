 Permanent own Link-Shortener

Long URLs can be difficult to manage, especially when Excel cells have character limits shorter than what's needed to store them. While browsing the web, I've noticed that available link shorteners often offer temporary links. Wouldn't it be cool to have a permanent link stored in a shortener? Voil√†!... you can find a practical solution to create your own personal URL
